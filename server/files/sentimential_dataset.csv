(because that's what they had previous customers do) so i went and got an account came back and was told i was denied cause i didn't have enought ""transaction history"". well of course not, duh.. i just opened they account 30 minutes ago. only transaction was the $50 i put in savings & $50 for the checking account. nevertheless i was denied. well let me get it right. i was offered $150. i also would've at least like to have been asked what amount i wanted. i was under the impression that the customer told them what they needed. also, i think both accounts should have been looked at.  i have been at my job for 8 years. i get paid weekly. and have been getting direct deposit to the same account the whole time. but ""no sir u don't qualify"" . that's what i get for listening to the commercials. damn near felt like false advertisement. but my boss ended up helping us out and sponsored my daughter. so, fortunately we were able to get a new piano. we had to keep some sense of sameness after all we've been through.",negative,positive

Amscot,US,5,"my first time experience with amscot was a total success and blessing in desquise. even though i went there with the hopes of being able to get a  $1000 loan bcuz i needed help,i soon learned after completing the application process that i didn't qualify for it which began causing me to feel sad confused an some type of way bcuz i didn't know who or what else to do after receiving such bad news in that moment, but luckily for me after the customer service rep explained to me the reasoning why i couldn't get that amount i began to feel a little better bcuz i was thinking it had something to do with my personal info or something else maybe which it didn't , it was bcuz of that being my first time doing business with them i wasn't gonna qualify for that amount until i've done more business with them so they could an would be able to track and monitor how well  good up to date and on time i was gonna be with keeping up with my scheduled return payments in order for them to know and or be comfortable with lending me that amount of their money which really helped me to know an also better understand why they couldn't do it at the moment but had no problems with allowing me to get it once i've done enough business with them to qualify for the $1000 loan that i know now i do qualify  can and will soon be getting just not right now which was an still is ok with me until later , bcuz he didn't stop there he made sure he did everything he could by checking to see if maybe i qualified for something lower to help me and omg he was successful with helping me get a $200 beginners loan which made my day bcuz i didn't think i was gonna be able to get anything being it was my first time so i would just like to say thank you guys so much for helping me out and i'm so looking forward to continuing doing business and being on time with my payments so that i can come get that $1000 loan i really can still use.",positive,positive

Amscot,US,1,the location on 49st hialeah open 24 is clean and very quick turn over. i went to this location around 8:30 pm and wait in line less than 10 minutes with was very impressive. the attendant who assisted with the cash advance needs additional training in customer service and basic loan application process. i asked for a cash advance and he started to inform me of the qualifications needed to qualify for the cash advance. i informed him that i had all documents ready to email. i show him my phone and he took my phone and began to scroll and send the email himself. he had an attitude when i asked him what he was doing with my phone. he asked for my phone to see my pay stub. which is ok but don‚Äôt stascrolling all you have to do is tell me what to send. i understand that most of the population of hialeah has a language barrier and they are used having to explain to assist to express the process. i informed him i have to document ready to email and he seemed annoyed that i told him i would email my bank statements and not give him my cell back. he proceeded to give me the application and i asked him for an english application as i can speak spanish but prefer important documents to be in english. he informed me that i was approved for $500.00. which then he gave me another application in spanish and told me to only sign it. i didn‚Äôt understand why i had to refill the application and why he would give it to me in spanish. i informed him that i would fill out the application and i did not need him to fill it out for me. he seemed upset and annoyed that i was filling out the application myself again. he then proceed to tell me that i was denied the loan because i had a cash advance with amscot. which i told him i didn‚Äôt he gave me a paper saying i was denied after just telling me that i was approved. he was like your only allowed one loan if you have concerns please contact the number on the paper. he was going on to the next customer. when i told him i have not gotten a loan from this company in over 7 years. he was talking to someone on the phone for about 10 minutes to fix the issue. needless to say my experience was longer than the average because the attendant assisting. the other attendant at this location were quick and seems to be very efficient with their customer. the lady that was next to him kept look at what he was doing and seemed confused why he was doing additional steps for my application. i am grateful i was able to obtain the loan but unhappy with the attitude he displayed towards me. it took me a longer wait time than it should have. please let me know if you would like for me to email the denial letter and my acceptance documents.,negative,positive
Amscot,US,2,they want a lot of bank info. and if your name is not on the statement that is on your account that they watched you pull up. that's not good enough. plus the teller that helped me was sooooo slow! he actually took a phone call and stopped my transaction and was in hurry to get off the phone.,negative,negative

Amscot,US,1,"went into amscot to get 3- 1,000 dollar money orders. the clerk max ask me for my id. i presented my city id along with my driver's license. he went further to ask for a phone number. i gave him the phone number and ask why all the questions? there was a woman in the store hearing my personal information. so i gave my information and still was asked what the money orders will be used for.at that point i said i was not answering any further questions. i ask are you going to give me the money orders or not.max replied no,so i said to give me back my money. i called the district leader of manatee county miss carey, she refused to give me her last name,it can be easily looked up. her answer was that's the way they have to ask questions. i find this to be so unprofessional for them to be asking these personal questions, not only degrading but in front of other people in their facility. why would anyone go to amscot to get money orders or to do business, when you can simply go to the united states postal and get money orders without being asked nonsense. my family and friends will not be using amscot for any reason what so ever.",negative,positive

(( as a huge company like amscit could doit right away ))but instead they lie to customers as its their policy ((to keep making money with it at the stock market)) by telling us  we do not know if its already been cashed ))really amscot !!??so what is the serial number for and the books of ids you require to do so for??so people please watch out for those practices ?other than that they have great services..we must admit it ..ok,negative,positive

Amscot,US,1,"if i could give 0 stars i would. i went into the palm coast location to do a small advance. i had called prior to going to make sure i had every thing i needed. this was my first time so i wanted to be prepared.i was told a bank statement with acct, direct deposit showing my employer name and my name on the statement along with my id was enough.i presented these items and was told it wasn‚Äôt enough.they needed more proof.so i gave them my insurance id cards with both my employers name and my name. not good enough. i didn‚Äôt want to drive all the way to my work to get a paystub so i asked if my w2 would work. nope. basically what i believe is going on is that the guy behind the counter is profiling me and doesn‚Äôt believe that due to my appearance that i am a head teller at a bank. it‚Äôs my off day so i am wearing my peircings. i also have blue in my hair. well i drove 40 minutes to the closest bank location and printed out 2 months worth of pay stubs, a page that shows my bank location information that also lists me as head teller and i have photos that show me working at the bank. i hope this is enough for the jerk at the palm coast location to no longer look at me like i am a criminal trying to pose as a bank employee",negative,positive

Amscot,US,1,waited about 2hours for something that could have taken 10 min. work on one customer at a time. i had to fill out papers then keep waiting for the clerk to be done with other people. this happened multiple times. every step we took the clerk went to help someone else. everyone else was in and out within 10-20 min. that was a terrible experience. i didn‚Äôt have a bank statement but that literally took me 2 minutes to get. and everytime i got my info or filled out a paper i had to wait 20 minutes again to ask a simple question. for example she said ‚Äúput your phone number on this line‚Äù. then proceeds to walk off and i had to wait for her to finish with the next person just to move on to the next step. good advice for this company would be work with one customer at a time.,negative,negative

Amscot,US,1,"discrimination complainti have been going to the amscot on 17-92 in longwood, fl for just about 2 yrs now on a regular basis (at least once a month) and have never been so embarrassed, upset and felt discriminated against as i was treated this evening by the manager anai.  i have a service dog which is alway on a leash and harness,  that i bring with me every time i come to this amscot branch or the branch in sanford, fl on reinhardt rd and never have i had someone treat me like this manager, anai treated me.  she first questioned if my dog was a service dog and when i replied yes, then she stated that she could not see my disability and requested documentation that my dog was in fact a service dog because she couldn't see that she was by her harness.  i then showed her proof and asked if they needed a copy for their file of which i was told no that's not necessary.   i felt embarrassed, humiliated and totally discriminated against. the florida statues clearly state that:chapter 413employment and related services for persons with disabilities413.08‚ÄÉrights and responsibilities of an individual with a disability; use of a service animal; prohibited discrimination in public employment, public accommodations, and housing accommodations; penalties.‚Äî(3)‚ÄÉan individual with a disability has the right to be accompanied by a service animal in all areas of a public accommodation that the public or customers are normally permitted to occupy.(a)‚ÄÉthe service animal must be under the control of its handler and must have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless either the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash, or other tether, or the use of a harness, leash, or other tether would interfere with the service animal‚Äôs safe, effective performance of work or tasks, in which case the service animal must be otherwise under the handler‚Äôs control by means of voice control, signals, or other effective means.*********(b)‚ÄÉdocumentation that the service animal is trained is not a precondition for providing service to an individual accompanied by a service animal. a public accommodation may not ask about the nature or extent of an individual‚Äôs disability. to determine the difference between a service animal and a pet, a public accommodation may ask if an animal is a service animal required because of a disability and what work or tasks the animal has been trained to perform.i called corporate about this and spoke to a supervisor by the name of echo who said they will handle it and apologized and said someone will call me about their course of action either tomorrow or  monday.  there was also another coworker at the branch by the name of keista or something like that and she has always been helpful and accommodating and has never said anything about my service dog as she is always harnessed and leashed and is always under control and well behaved. she witnessed what happened as well.i am not sure what else i can do but i felt so humiliated, embarrassed and totally discriminated against.  people with disabilities  with service animals, please be warned of this manager.  totally unacceptable behavior and a violation of the florida statues.update 2-7-2020 - 8:39pm -  i am not sure what the resolution was as i was never advised as to what actions were taken so i am waiting patiently to hear back from corporate as to what resolution they are speaking of.",negative,positive

Amscot,US,2,"it would have been better if the service agent had shown me a little more attentiveness. instead she was jumping from customer to customer every time she asked me to sign a paper. while she was reviewing my paper work she did the same thing. she would enter a couple of things then go and wait on other people. i could have had a a little more understanding had she been by herself but she had another person with her who was mainly walking around doing nothing. that other person was waiting on a customer to make a call to the bank to verify a ss deposit. in the mean time she just strolled around not helping anyone else. to top it all off they were not very friendly at all. very bad customer relation skills and attitude. i asked do i make the check out to amscot and she said yes. when i started to write out my check the service agent waiting on me said, stop, i wouldn't write that check out if i were you. we have a certain way we like it made out. i had only written amscot at that point and was awaiting for her to tell me how much to make it out for. when all was said and done the check was written out the way all checks are written. there was no special way about it. i felt like an child at that point. not to mention i spent almost 55 minutes there applying for a $200.00 payday advance. you're not giving me anything, i have to pay a fee for this service. the attitude was like, ""i don't care about how long it takes to do your transaction because you need me, i really don't need you"". when i left there i almost felt like a 2nd class citizen. i noticed that people of color were treated much better and with a smile. that shouldn't even come into play. almost everyone has a little financial trouble now and then but i can a sure you this i'll be hard pressed to need you in the future. it wasn't a pleasure doing business with you.",negative,positive

Amscot,US,1,i called an hour ahead of time to ask specific questions about the cash advance process. i let the staff member (kathy) know that i was interested in getting a cash advance and let her know that i just started my new job. i informed kathy that i have only recieved one paycheck from my new job so far and that the amount of the paystub is only half of what i would actually be making biweekly because i started the job mid pay period. i emphasized this factor because i wanted to know for sure if they would consider what i was making biweekly with a full pay period check (hence receiving the full benefit of the cash advance based on what my real biweekly check amounts would be) and kathy said yes that would be acceptable as long as i had proof of payroll and bank account info that my checks are deposited.  when i got there (there were 2 female staff members; both hispanic) i was already being helped by kathy when she all of the sudden walked away from processing my cash advance. she didnt say a word to me before walking off to assist another person (a white male) who just came in the store. i stood there waiting for almost 30mins while she finished helping him. the other staff member there was doing everything except helping me. i had asked them both multiple times if there was something wrong with my application. they both ignored me while communicating with each other in spanish until i practically yelled my question. one of them (not kathy) finally acknowledged me but in a manner that was pretty much brushing me off. they didnt come back to help me until kathy finished assisting the other customer. i was in there for about an hour for something that should've taken 30mins or less! it was unacceptable for her to stahelping someone else when i was there first! horrible service! i feel that i was discriminated against (whether intentional or not)   i am a black woman and i was not treated like a valued customer like the gentleman beside me did.,negative,positive

Amscot,US,1,i have been a loyal customer for over 10+ years now and i inquired about a cash advance without a checking out to which they now offer so long as you have a prepaid debit card and show proof of direct deposit for and from employment. after standing for than 45 mins at one of their locations i was denied a cash advance because i am an existing customer and also because i have not used cash advance with them since 2009. so in other words they'd rather lose a loyal 10+yr customer rather than approve me even though i met all of the requested and required document. this was told to me by a supervisor at their corporate office. makes absolutely no sense at all. therefore after 10+ yrs i will no longer be a customer of theirs. they only care about new customers. this is not made up people. i know it sounds crazy and all but imagine how upset i was.. i was let down. poor excuse and reason not to assist me.,negative,negative

Amscot,US,1,"horrible 1st impression for a first-time customer! don't even know the lady's name who helped me, but she had no clue what she was doing, the manager jeff was so slow other people were waited on even though i was there first!  apparently only the manager jeff is authorized to handle loans so i got stuck back in the line even though i was there way before everyone else and i do not appreciate that whatsoever! very poor system! i had to leave because i had a doctor's appointment, i was there for 45 minutes to set up a new account and i had to leave because they still cannot figure out what was going on. i emailed my bank statement the day before and spoke to kaylee who said that they received it. nowhere today did anyone find my paperwork so i had to email it again and the woman who helped me said she still couldn't find it it was ridiculous beyond belief!. they got me so upset at amscot my blood pressure went through the roof and my doctor's office was furious at how upset i was that it caused me to have my blood pressure go through the roof which is not the norm for me! had to go back and deal with that nonsense again after talking to the manager jeff over the phone and they lost my paperwork. basically 1.5 hours of my life i'll never get back! i will pay them back but never using them again! do not recommend!  honestly, my time is valuable, having to wait 45 minutes, then have to come back and take another 30 minutes on 2nd trip  is unacceptable and and i feel i shouldn't even have to pay the interest back on my loan for the major inconvenience and lack of knowledge and professionalism at amscot!",negative,negative

Amscot,US,5,"there really isn't much to not like about amscot. i was new to florida when i first found them. first of all the fees are way more reasonable in florida than in ohio. i don't want to say much about that because i don't want them to rise. but they are reasonable for people who need the service. they offer many types of services. i haven't used them all so i will only talk about the ones i have used. free money orders! fantastic. reminds me of the old pre savings and loan days. great for giving gifts and paying bills. buying a sunpass. the only negative was having to use cash to load it the first time. i tend to not carry cash. but luckily i had some. loan fees are very reasonable. the amounts are low for me and they don't encourage debt. the staff is always friendly and professional although they could use more that is a company decision about staffing and not the fault of the staff itself. i've only three offices but those were all very clean. pride shows in how you keep your customer service area. i've never had to wait long. i'm always acknowledged although not always recognized as a repeat customer, the  only negative is that the staff doesn't always relate and try to build a rapport. they are friendly and professional yet a little distant. since i've never had a problem or issue with needing more than they offer i can't comment on how they handle negative situations. i'm sure they handle it professionally though. they always ask if i need money orders or stamps which is good as a reminder. i do wish there was a 24 hour office closer.",positive,positive

Oportun,US,1,"i was pre-approved for a 4g debt consolidation loan through oportun issued by pathward. i filled out the loan application with all my information, verified the terms of the loan, and confirmed i needed 4g for debt consolidation. i was offered the loan and guaranteed approval by credit karma. my credit card debt, verified by credit karma, is $3,600. a 4g debt consolidation loan would allow me to pay off all of my credit cards and only owe oportun. when the loan came back for my signature, oportun had switched the loan amount from $4g to $1,500. a debt consolidation loan, by definition, pays off debt. i would not be paying off the oportun loan in addition to my other debts. my oportun loan would replace my other debt. therefore, it makes no sense why they changed loan amounts on the final paperwork. thank goodness i read everything before signing!i politely declined oportun's bait and switch. i got phonecalls, emails, and texts. oportun really wanted me to have this loan. finally, i decided to pay off my smaller balance cards so i only had the oportun loan and one other credit card, so i accepted the loan.it's important to note, oportun has all my personal information - bank statements, bank account numbers, etc. everything i listed on my loan application matches my documentation to the penny.this time their $1,500 line became $500. absolutely absurd! i am so worried about them having all my personal information. i honestly cannot believe credit karma recommended them. i wish i had never heard of them.",negative,positive

Oportun,US,2,"at some point, these people acquired the digit app abruptly and that is why they earned this 2-star review.   customer service specifically for the app and those that 'transferred over when the migration took place has been abysmal at best. i tried to cancel my digit account when it was still digit and they refused to comply with the request.    the account remained open without my knowledge, i finally discovered that probably a month or two ago and discovered that digit was now opportun.  yeah, it should have stayed digit.  but like with most things when the big guys get their hands on something -- it typically is ruined in record time.    opportun is trying to collect further private and personal information for customers related to the digit app even though there are users of what was digit who aren't actually customers of opportun itself.   opportun randomly (and i mean completely at random) sent me an e-mail stating that my account had been ordered frozen with no explanation but they made sure to demand all sorts of private information including a gov't id; a utility bill, a bank statement and so on.  uh yeah no, i am not providing this to a company i have largely never heard of until they swooped in and bought or however they seem to have acquired digit.  i am no longer a customer because i refused to hand over more information with no explanation from these people. i thought that was very unprofessional and would not recommend 'digit' to anyone.  your account can *and at their discretion* not yours at any time be closed if you do not comply with their demands.  in this day and age, no way am i handing over info to a company that i have never done personal business with and only know their name because they acquired a previous app i did business with.  too sketchy.",negative,positive

Oportun,US,1,"in my 33 yrs of life experience in horrible customer service. i am not exaggerating, oportun is 1 on my poop list. goodness, these ppl literally just collect a paycheck to send off scripts, saying ""i'm sorry"" and repeating the same thing over and over again just in a different way. it all started with a simple email, with a simple request - changing my phone number so i could access my account (because of security measures, it was sending it to my old phone number). this is the most routine and common security procedure that occurs with similar companies but with oportun...omggg this dragged on for days with back-and-forth emails that lead to more and more requests to prove myself that it was indeed, i, the account holder. this whole process did not include my verifying my id, social, and/or address...nope, a full bank statement with digit transactions from an account that was already closed. the whole reason i was trying to change my phone number was to update all the information i knew was outdated in the first place!!! i explained all of this and still, these imbeciles could not make a simple change or get me into my account. by the grace of the patience gods, i was able to log in once more into my account online without their assistance of course. i was then able to select close account. to my dismay, the website prompted me to send the balance in my account to the closed bank account!! i selected the option to mail it to me in a form of a check. i'm assuming for security purposes, again, it directed back to the ppl i hate the most now - oportun support. i sent the email and explained everything again...and these numbed brains email me back ""we've closed your account and have sent it to the account on file"" after i just told them, that account is closed!!! seriously, i don't know how slow you have to be to not understand your customers when they're literally explaining everything to you. this brought me to the conclusion that they don't give af and don't read. would not trust these ppl with my money or business, can't even trust them to do simple tasks of reading and listening let alone, critical thinking.",negative,positive

Oportun,US,5,"right off the bat, when i tried applying online, i was already offered a personal or secured personal loan. i would've done the secured personal loan but i didn't need to loan that much amount so i stuck with the personal loan. there were a few bumps when i applied because for some reason, the rep i spoke with applied me for a secured loan which i didnt want because i would have to put my car as a collateral but i made sure i wanted to go through with the personal loan. it took a day for them to get back to me with the correct type of loan. on saturday, they called me and said that everything looked good. much to my surprise, i could pick up the check on the same day. and had i gone to their office right away, i would've been able to deposit or cash it already. but it was fine. overall experience tho, it was swift. the interest rate x the number of months you need to pay is a reasonable percentage and amount. their office hours made it really convenient for me as well since i work 6 days a week. their office being open on a weekend takes off a huge worry. also, the staff that assisted me with my loan in the office was really helpful and made sure i understood what the keywords i needed to know on regards with my loan.",positive,positive

Oportun,US,5,"excellent first-time experience! wow. i was worried because i never have applied for a personal loan before, and the first place i considered applying was pretty strict in their requirements.  was told to try opportun so i checked out the website. the info there led me to believe it would be something that i could receive from them. went through all the steps, called them a few times for clarity, talked to a loved one who had used them before. it took a while to finish for me because i just haggled about everything and had to do research, and check and double check things and talk it out with family but the actual process on their end is very quick. was preapproved, filled out some tidbits of information about my household monthly payments and dependents, added a bank account, submitted my income verification and that was it! they didn't call me, they didn't ask for additional documentation. it was all good! i was approved within an hour. had to choose my loan and terms, signed my papers, and within maybe 1-2 hours of that got an email that my loan was disbursed! same day approval! the email said it would be 1-3 days to receive it in my bank account. it was 2 days. i thought it would be there in the morning but it wasn't. i figured after a certain point it would be 3 days but the funds showed up in my account after 5pm! who knew! simple, easy, and awesome! thank you, opportun! this really made a big difference for me at the last minute! keep up the great work! people need this service! please never change! couple notes for users: i believe adding a bank account made a big difference in the speed of getting approved and receiving the funds. if you can add one, do it! they even tell you that it would speed things up and they give you a bonus! also, before submitting my app for final review, i called them to ask about my income verification documents. i wasn't sure if they would be acceptable. i hadn't acutally submitted anything yet but i had uploaded my docs. the lady i spoke with could see them. she had me on hold for a while but she assured  me that it was fine and i could go forward. she was right! and i'm self-employed so i don't have normal paystubs and my bank statements were aggregated amongst multiple accounts so i couldn't provide them without giving all my accounts. sent my payment invoices instead. so, if i can do it, so can you! don't be discouraged and just call them if you have questions! great experience!",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,this is the most fraudulent company ever . i am sure their reviews are as well. i have been in the hospital deathly ill and needed a quick loan to pay off bills for my autistic non profit. i signed and they never explained they would be taken 500 a week for 9 k. to amount to 14 k or more. what a scam. all my checks to fund my supportive housing bounced and all my credit  was ruined because of this company. they are crooks. they try to act like they care then withdraw every cent you have immediately and ruin your life. what a sham for honest workers that are trying so hard to serve humanity. they should be taken off the map. as well i saw so many class actions suits against them for the same reason. please be aware. a scam company taking advantage of financially vulnerable people trying to get back on their feet post covid. shame on all of you. no one is ever from america. i am sure you have slave wages to have all these third world people harass you. all the positive reviews are written by third world slave wage workers.,negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"what a frustrating, time-wasting experience.we engaged biz2credit after we'd already worked with bottom line concepts successfully, and got approval from the irs for our employee retention credit.  biz2credit was supposed to loan us the refundable amount so that we could receive the funds more quickly than the irs would release them.  biz2credit gave us the runaround for appx 4 months and, in the end, we began receiving our refunds 2 weeks later directly from the us treasury.  we cancelled our account with biz2credit and feel they were grossly inefficient in every way that they conducted business with us. for example: they were ridiculously repetitive!  time after time we were asked for the same materials.  wasted hours,  because at first they ""required"" everything to be in pdf format but suddenly it was ok, they would accept jpeg. (so why did we waste two weeks trying to convefiles?)  they continuously  ""lost"" documents and blamed us for not submitting them, but we had a record of sending because we kept everything in chronological order.  the worst of all, however, was that they kept pressuring us to get our cpat to create something from scratch called a ""proof of eligibility"" form, and of course he refused.   what right did they have to employ our accountant?  even worse, they requested that we get our original consultants for the erc, bottom line concepts, to put reports together for biz2credit's convenience, and wisely, they refused.  (bottom line concepts is an excellent high-integrity company).  throughout our engagement with biz2credit, there were numerous conflicting and confusing requests, as well as promises that ""we can get you the money in two days!!"" for a higher percentage, of course.  they would actually tell us that if they got whatever new piece of documentation they had thought up that day, we would get a wire transfer in a day or two.  infuriatingly, the only thing we received after complying with their demands was....more demands. also, they probably make more money selling your contact information:  after dealing with biz2credit, we were inundated with spam and sales calls from similar lending institutions trying to push their commercial loan products on us.  we have never experienced this before and we believe it came from them.in retrospect, we would have been better off having never dealt with biz2credit.  it cost us time, money, and aggravation.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"if you are a professional services-based business, do not work with this company. i have had multiple merchant advance loans with biz2credit. each of which has been paid off in full. most recently, during this holiday season, business was slow in december. my payments got behind. i was behind approximately $742. biz2credit sent ucc letters to individuals who i no longer did business with asking them if they owed me any money, and if they did, to send the money to biz2credit. my services are offered on a flat fee basis so i don't have any genuine ""receivables."" as such, biz2credit was simply sending letters to old clients who i could potentially do business with again and advising them of the arrears, potentially harming any future business i could do with said parties. i tried to explain this to my account representative and he said, ""well you've done business with them in the past so we are allowed to send them a letter."" this statement was incorrect based on the contract. they are allowed to send letters out to people who owe me money, i.e. accounts receivable. they had no list of anyone who owed me money so they sent letters out to old clients and damaged my business and any potential for me to work with those parties again. they then sent a letter to my merchant square and had all transactions held. i agreed to send letter requesting that square turn over $800 directly to them. the language on their letter said that they wanted the full balance in my square account. the full loan balance was $5400. the balance in my square account that was on hold was over $8k. they wouldn't be entitled to the full amount in my account. however, they requested the full balance and have prevented any transactions from being deposited into my business account for over two weeks. they have tried to get paid more than they are actually owed from my merchant. they have sent letters to individuals and businesses who do not owe me money and interfered with any potential business relationship i could have with them. when you call the new york office you are transferred to call centers offshore. in response to the ucc letter, there is one individual, christina bruitt, who is us based, who you can speak with but she doesn't know anything about any files and transfers you back to the offshore team who initiated the fraudulent request for the overage. they are fine if you need a quick loan and you are maybe a restaurant or a business with regular daily transactions. if you are a professional service-based business, run. they do not understand how you operate, you will not understand the thick accents of anyone you speak with on the offshore team when an issue may arise, they will not take the time to understand the nature of your business or work with you on a resolution, and you will end up with compounded issues. all of the funds in my account are behind held because i was 9 days ($742) behind. the funds are in the square account to pay and resolve the matter but cannot be released to even pay them because of biz2credit. do not do business with this off shore company unless you absolutely have to. it could make matters worse for your business. my business will likely close before the end of the year because of how they do business. proceed with extreme caution.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"you must have an account with big bank, it can‚Äôt be a smaller, online or independent institution.  they‚Äôre not a supporter of actual small businesses.update:  here is more info.  my small business, with 1 employee with 145k in revenue, was denied multiple loans because i don't have an account with a major bank.  i am a freelancer and have a bank specifically designed for freelancers.  no fees, no overdrafts, just simple convenient banking.  it is online and there are no brick and mortar locations.  it is fdic insured through a major bank, but the transactions are handled by an app.  therefor i was denied even a further look based on the fact that i don't have a ""traditional bank"".  on 1/20/22 i received an email blast about the ppp program.  a program that was finished over a year ago and no longer giving out money.  i was also provided this link:  caresactsmallbusiness.info to assist in my efforts to secure a loan through a no longer in existence program, that link is broken.  caresactsmallbusiness.info. when i replied to the email info at biz2credit dot com that was provided in the email, it was returned ""undeliverable"".  this was another portion of that email: ""biz2credit understands that business owners need suppoand guidance during this time of unprecedented uncertainty in our economy. we are standing with business owners and providing assistance in multiple ways.""multiple ways??? firstly with a ppp program that doesn't exist anymore?  thats just one, please inform me if you can... what are the ""multiple"" ways as i have not seen evidence of even one.  a truer statement would be, ""we are staying with certain businesses that meet our specific requirements only.""update update:  they replied with a typical copy and paste and they are not concerned at all with my business or it's ability to thrive.  i provided email documentation going back to 2018 to trustpilot which then verified and approved my post.",negative,positive

(which another idiot told me was 5% simple interest!).  i mean, maybe this is good if you just got out of jail for wire fraud, but not in the real land of business.  we secured funding from our bank at a fraction of this cost.  since declining, they call, text, email and harass me constantly!  asking if i want more money.  i told them flat out, we will never use this company for anything, ever!  in my experience, any ""good"" reviews are almost certainly fake, as the business practices are just horrible.  the used car lot of loan sites.  avoid them at all costs.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,"** i plan to keep posting this daily, since they try and drown out my review with fake reviews. when they try to override my review, i will repost. i will do this all day, if need be. i ask that trustpilot please look at this page, because they are putting fake reviews so no one sees a real review. you will see that as i post this review, there will be 10 or so that will follow to move me to the 2nd page. i have no issue updating my review, if they address my issue because i never cancelled my loan. if not, i will continue post this review, until there is some integrity again on trustpilot. disappointed in biz2credit. unfortunately, this review may not get seen because it will get drowned out by the fake reviews they will likely post to keep from having their overall rating drop. i do plan to have this looked into for creditability of trustpilot website, i use to trust in their reviews, now i have lost faith in using them to make any decisions on a company in the future. biz2credit helped my business grow to what it is today, so i want to first give them credit for the non-ppp loans in the past. my first draw for ppp went smooth and was transferred to my bank account. my 2nd draw was a disappointment and full of dishonesty, which hume as someone that really liked working with biz2credit. they made a mistake a cancelled my loan, but then turned around and accused me of saying i wanted it cancelled - which i never did and have the email proof to back this. who would cancel a max loan for $20k that was approved? i intend to get on sba nerves until someone looks into this case for me. i also am a minority owned business and i hope this had nothing to do with it, but will want this investigated. i could have used so many other lenders, but used them because of their track record in the past with my business. i've also referred them as well, which i will no longer do. i give the rating of one star because lying which in my book is the lowest of lows. i will update this as i get more feedback from sba and whoever i am recommended to speak with. for those who see this before it gets drowned out by the fake reviews they will post i encourage you not to use them for any loans moving forward. something has changed with this company since i first used them and it's not good.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,5,"i worked with biz2credit on both applying for a ppp loan, and then applying for loan forgiveness. they have a very robust web interface that walked me through all the necessary steps; it clearly outlined the documentation i needed to provide, and visually tracked my progress so that i knew, at a glance, how far along i had gotten and exactly how many steps remained. because there were so many people going through the same process, it was not possible to talk to someone on the phone to ask if i had done everything properly. i had to trust that their system was guiding me correctly, and trust that the documentation was being reviewed (and that i would be informed if something was wrong or missing). and, indeed, the system must have captured everything because our loan application was approved and the loan funded very, very quickly. their system knew when it was time for me to apply for forgiveness, and sent out notifications to ensure i wasn't forgetting. when i began the process, i was shocked by how simple it was. i thought for sure i wasn't fully understanding what i needed to do; the simplicity was almost a little scary, because when are things ever just so easy? i delayed submitting the loan forgiveness application while i researched independently to see if it really was that simple. in the end, i decided to once again trust that their website was guiding me correctly, and that was the right decision. within days of submitting the forgiveness application, i received notification that the ppp loan was forgiven. i am very grateful to the entire biz2credit team, and anurag in particular, for guiding me so clearly through the applications and obviously watching over the entire process on their end, even if i never got to talk to anyone or see any of the behind-the-scenes effothat surely went into every single application.",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"this was one of the most difficult and frustrating experiences of my life as a business owner, to the point where i was convinced at several points along the way that this was a full on scam. for a long time, it was impossible to get ahold of anyone to ask questions. then, once someone was on my case, it felt like they weren't listening to me. even after i had said several times that i was applying as a sole contractor for owner compensation, they were asking repeatedly for the form 940 or 941 for payroll, which i do not have. there was no where on the biz2credit application to indicate this distinction. no one responded when i asked how to show proof of owner compensation or 1099 contractor payment. then, i found a critical mistake on the application form that they wanted me to sign on docusign (that it still claimed i had employees to pay), and it took days to fix.then, they would ask, over and over again, for me to connect my bank account after i had told them dozens of times that my credit union wasn't in the list of options. there were seemingly several people picking up my case, so i had to say the same thing over and over again. they call from a number that came up on my caller id as ""spam risk"", which also does not help. in the end, my ppp was funded four months after i applied. i am grateful that it went through, but the headache was immense.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,"biz2credit is horrible! do not use for ppp loan application. as so many other people have said in their reviews, you can't get in touch with an actual person to get help. i've been in automated email hell since i applied on march 10. it is obvious that all the 5 star reviews on here are fake. the 1 star reviews are sharing actual experiences and are the ones to be believed. biz2credit ¬†hides anything but 5 star reviews on their facebook page. they do not respond to tweets. they do not answer their phone or respond to voice messages. they do not respond to emails aside from automated responses coming weeks later that do not address the questions and concerns of the email that i sent.my ""funding specialist"" is deepak tyagi. i have sent numerous emails, i have not heard from him.here is a breakdown of my exact experience which i emailed to every email address i could find for them on april 5:""i am writing again requesting to withdraw my application biz 2783022. i have had numerous problems with your company and have had zero response or resolution from anyone. here is the summary of events:i applied for the ppp loan on march 10. the only reason i went with biz2credit was because i was trying to get in under the showindow for applications for sole proprietors and my regular bank, chase was not accepting applications at that time with the revised sole proprietor guidelines. mar 19: i received the docusign documents to sign. upon reviewing the documents, i found two errors that needed to be corrected. 1) my apartment number was not listed on the application even though i had entered it in originally. 2) i discovered that the naics code i entered did not match what my accountant had put on my tax return. ¬†the docusign instructions specifically state to make sure everything is correct and not to sign if incorrect. so, i did not sign.mar 21: i emailed about these items that needed to be corrected. i heard no response other than an automated reply.mar 24: i emailed again to find out how to correct these things and still no reply. i called and left a voicemail on this day as well.mar 24: i called the sba to inquire about what to do because i am losing faith in your company. they said the lender has to withdraw the application to be able to go to another lender.i then started searching for info online and discovered that you have terrible reviews from people experiencing similar situations and i determined for sure that i want to withdraw my application. mar 26: i emailed stating that i want to withdraw my application. no response to that, but i did receive an auto email that same day, mar 26, asking me to upload my 1040 tax form within 48 hours and that if i did not, my application would be withdrawn. i want my application withdrawn, so i did not submit the document. i see nowhere on your website that i can withdraw my application myself nor is there any option to correct information that has been submitted. the only thing i can do is upload documents, so i uploaded a document stating that i want to withdraw my application. i called and left voicemail messages again this day as well. i also officially declined to sign the docusign documents that were emailed to me. with no responses so far and no other options, i signed up for your webinar hoping to get some answers.mar 29: i attended the webinar on ppp steps. i asked questions on the webinar about how to withdraw my application and got an auto reply that said my question would be answered within 24 hours. i have heard nothing.it is now april 5 and i have received zero response from any of my correspondence. i have logged into my account and my application is still active with an sba loan (e-tran) . this is unacceptable. to reiterate, all i am asking for at this point is to have my ppp application withdrawn immediately so that i can go to my regular bank for a loan. i do not trust your company. if i do not see my application withdrawn or get a reply from an actual person (not an automated reply), my next steps are going to be leaving negative reviews outlining my detailed experience on every review site i can find. thank you,jeremy weinglass""i did not receive any response until april 12 and below is the automated email i received, which apparently was a reply to my email from march 24. it clearly does not address my questions and provides no assistance whatsoever.

Biz2Credit,US,1,"update 4/24/21:finally received a phone call in the morning, and low and behold, i explained exactly what i had said previously to at least 8 other ppl. guess what? that call was maybe 5 minutes including him listening and sending me the correct url, waiting as i logged in, and was verified. he was very accommodating and kind. although, now i had signed my 2483 on the 5th of april, so i'm still pretty much concerned, as again now after verification of bank account, they put me back to final re-verification. from what i was told, i should have received my closing documents within hours of that, and i guess i thought they would possibly walk my application through to the funding stage, being that they have wasted almost a month of time by just ignoring my requests, when in fact this could have been avoided in the first place. i will continue to update my review, as well as adjust my score accordingly, depending on how long it takes to get funded, and if they show any concern for myself or my business, by urgently processing my application. it appears they are sincerely trying to rectify this situation, so i have reserved optimism for a timely resolution. 4/23/21: this is beyond disgusting to me.... i have reached out numerous times with the new information, they asked for my phone number repeatedly after i already sent it in a reply every time, and they still have not called. i finally contacted yodlee and here is their reply, which i again forwarded to biz2credit with no response. ***just to reiterate, i've been funded 1st round in january through them with this same account. i have also even emailed my initial closing documents, as well as a video showing that what they are requesting isn't possible until they send me a link to manually add my bank. ***here's the email and response from yodlee... hi jen,thank you for your email and apologies for the inconvenience.we would request that the concern be raised with biz2credit‚Äôs suppoteam and request them to raise a service request with yodlee to have this checked, as this would be the most efficient way to repoan issue as we depend on some key fields to aid our investigation and only biz2credit can provide that.request you to kindly confirm with biz2credit if they have raised a service request already with us. if yes, please request them to escalate the same to yodlee so that our teams can have this checked on priority.regards,*****notpostingname*****here's my email i initially sent:good morning,first of all, i apologize if this email is lengthy, but i want to eliminate the need for even more of your time taken up via extra emails with additional questions. overview:  i am having difficulty verifying my bank account for my 2nd ppp loan. i have already been approved and funds are reserved for me, but biz2credit requires me to be verified.  (even though my information is the exact same as it was the 1st round off ppp, including the same banking information.) i'm passed the 20 day mark since the sba has issued my etran number, so at basically any moment they could cancel my loan funds. this would be what will cause me to lose my salon. (i opened my salon in 2019, at 40 yrs old, using every cent of my life savings, betting on myself to be successful. did not turn a profit until late december 2019/january 2020.) obviously, the pandemic devastated small business since then, and this is my last option.i have verified that my bank is an accepted lender via an up to date list of your lenders/banks. my bank is axos. for some reason it is not showing up on your bank list for verification. i was told that i need to manually upload the information for my bank. i have repeatedly searched for the link to do this, as i remember at one time seeing it underneath the list of banks on that same webpage. i have tried to find it iff of an android phone, both chrome and safari browsers, my ipad pro, both chrome and safari browsers, and my laptop, both chrome and microsoft edge browsers. i have tried on both mobile networks and my wifi.  i understand that you might think that i need to contact biz2credit, which i also would assume. i have. repeatedly. i have emailed the higher ups as well as the new person the assign to my case daily, which requires hours of email back and forth going over the same information that you would think would be documented by now.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"i am sorry but i have to give this company one star (it would be zero) because they are extremely unprofessional. i received my funding back in february and the process only took 5 days. i was invited to apply for draw 2 and submitted all the necessary paperwork and was in pre-verification. i was then asked to provide my banking information via yodlee which isn't a problem until i found out my bank isn't even listed in their database. i bank with us bank and they have it listed under singlepoint which is a paid service available to corporate businesses, nothing to do with the actually bank account login. i called us bank twice and they are also confused on what is being asked. i have reached out to numerous specialists, called, and suppoand no one is bothering to respond to me. also, my colleague also banks with us bank and was able to link her account only to wake up today and see her application withdrawn. at this point i am so confused and hate to leave a horrible review but this is completely unprofessional.updated may 15th: so after posting this review a few days later i was assigned a loan agent who called and emailed me every other day to help streamline my process. he even helped with the linking my bank account issue. i received an email from another agent with the subject line ""last document needed for approved contract"" and it was my bank statements highlighted with all my payroll transactions. i woke up the next morning with my dashboard saying approved and them emailing me saying my contract should be sent soon. fast forward two days later back on more information needed and they are asking for tax documents, and a lot of other things. when i looked in the dashboard i see the documents they pulled on their end and its complete breakdowns of my bank activity, my complete taxes from the last five years, database searches, and much more. i didn't mind because my business is legit but what bothered me is why they were still asking me to provide things they pulled straight from the companies themselves. also, i have access the loan portal newsletter and in it they say 1040 filers do not have to provide any documentation to showcase they spent their draw one in order to be approved. my application was withdrawn on their end yesterday and said it was because of my paperwork.....the same paperwork their internal team is telling them to not request. so biz2credit is a legit scam.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,4,"our small company filed with biz2credit for a first time ppp loan (in the second funding cycle) in the beginning of feb '21, after being told by our bank that they were not participating in the ppp program at that time. within a few days of completing the online application and uploading our documentation, we received an email stating that our loan had been approved by biz2 and that it was in the process of putting together the loan documents for us to sign for funding. about a month after this string of emails, a new string started that notified us that our loan documents (promissory note) needed to be signed or the loan would not be funded; each email stated that we had been sent the loan docs by ""docusign"". the problem was that we had never received any email containing a ""docusign"" link for the loan docs. each time that we responded that we could not execute the loan docs and asked to have them re-sent, we received a new email stating that we needed to sign the loan docs. very frustrating. because this company's processing path is completely online, it was impossible to get ahold of anyone to actually address the problem and we were caught up in a whirlpool of emails that were auto-creations. finally, we contacted someone in management through a path outside the company. this individual involved herself immediately, got to the bottom of the problem in our account, pulled in a specific individual to handle our application, and fixed the situation in a matter of days. this company may have some processing and customer communication problems related to being overwhelmed by the number of ppp applications that it has received, but the upper management of the company demonstrated a ""hands on"" approach to our problem and is clearly personally invested in the company's service to its customers. our experience is a better indicator of the company's performance than a glowing review that provides no insight. we think that the manner in which a problem is addressed is the best measurement of a company's culture. its easy to be great when there are no boulders in the stream to navigate. i would give biz2 a 5 star review, but to me that is a perfect mark; if the rating were to be limited to their response when our problem was finally sucked out of the email whirlpool, they should get a 5.",positive,positive
Biz2Credit,US,1,this is my third time using biz2credit first time was ok second time was ridiculous they asked for things the sba didn‚Äôt ask for so i withdrew my application went with smartbiz got through quickly. now this is my second draw for the first one i did with them and i‚Äôm so upset they have been giving me the run around about my application it has been stuck since the 4th no movements nothing now they have stopped responding to my emails and my phone calls all they do is keep lying to me about my application i have been told over and over they have escalated it wait 12-14 days and nothing happens they just keep giving me the run around and they ask for things that the sba didn‚Äôt just to get you through be careful and if you can avoid them please do.,negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,5,"prior to applying for my second draw ppp loan with biz2credit i first applied to the bank who did my first draw loan, cross country bank. after about 3 weeks they said loan was rejected but gave no specific reason why. then i went to wells fargo where i do my regular banking. first they reject me for missing information, so i reapply and provide the information only to get rejected saying they couldn't verify my first draw sba loan number. whether i entered it wrong or not i will never know. in both cases i had nobody to give me any guidance and a chance to correct the mistakes before they arbitrarily rejected me. then i got more aggressive and applied with 3 lenders simultaneously, one being biz2credit. that same day i get an email from one of the other banks who i will not name here being that this is a review for biz2credit. the loan officer from that bank told me how my partners drivers license didn't upload. that could very well have been the problem with my rejection with cross river but nobody there let me know. there were other documents this officer asked for so i sent it all to him the next day and then he proceeded to send my application to the sba. as i am sure many of you reading this will predict the sba kicked it back saying i was already approved. i feel bad now knowing this guy wasted his time on me. had i completed my application with this bank i would have gotten my funding in 2 to 3 weeks instead of the more than 2 months it took with biz2credit. i see how many other companies voiced frustration knowing that biz2credit right away sends the application to seize your sba loan number but i have to admit it is a brilliant move in order that they don't waste their limited manpower on companies only to learn another bank beat them to the punch. so on feb 22 i submitted my application and as happens to everyone that status remains ""information needed"". it wasn't until march 8 that i see my loan officer assigned to my loan on the website. tommy quinones.  i emailed him asking to confirm he has everything needed to mark my application completed. he promptly answers with 3 items needed one of which was my partners license which originally was sent in the wrong format. at this point the delay was my fault that i didn't realize i had to upload the license in a different way. then a couple more weeks go by and i am told i need to sign the irs form 8821. my accountant was very weary of signing it because it gave authorization to go all the way back to 2006. after doing my own due diligence and seeing other companies were being asked to sign this form i correctly decided there was no harm in submitting it. as i write this review today i still don't know how far back they actually looked at my company tax returns. so i submitted the form and one more bank statement i was told was needed and emailed tommy that it was submitted. i waited another week and emailed him again asked when i can get loan closing documents. then he answered me that my application is on hold at the underwriting department for approval. 3 days after that email i got the loan closing documents to sign. then 2 business days later the funds were in my account. i was fortunate enough to be able to wait out the process before getting my funding 2 months later. and as i indicated it was partly my fault as well. i will also say that a couple of times tommy emailed me on the weekend. so i have no doubt these guys are working countless hours to process the multitude of applications the are getting. for those of you going through a rough time with this lender just hang in there and get the documents to them promptly. you will be funded. thank you tommy quinones for your service. i can only imagine how many loans you are busy processing.",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,5,"my experience with biz2credit was great! my problem is that the sba originally reserved $12,952 for my company and we were absolutely thrilled because that meant i could hire my guys back on and get back to work making money! then after all of the paper work and emails and waiting to hear something then more paper work and uploads and emails i find out after 2 months that i will receive a little over $1600. this is a slap in the face basically and because it took so long and honestly just isn‚Äôt enough to do anything with we will likely have to close our business. we held on as long as we could. thank you for listening,shawn kaiseroh and to ad to this explanation, i was approved for an eidl loan of $10,500 which would have been a huge help but the funds were deposited into a personal acct and the bank sent it back to the sba. i was told it would be re deposited after i sent in a voided check for our business acct, the same one i sent to biz2credit, and still haven‚Äôt gotten that. this was 3 months ago now. so you can see we have pretty much just given up hope all together.",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"causing a lot of unnecessary stress! first let me say that i completely understand that the company is swamped with applications but when i am emailed countless times requesting me to complete the same tasks over & over again, for which i have already completed, up loaded, and notified them of it. even then the emails contain absolutely zero direction, in case i did something wrong..only says ‚Äú do this now ‚Äú or ‚Äú you need to do this ‚Äú just seems redundant and causes a lot of unnecessary stress.. i am not saying that the company is bad or untrustworthy, quite the opposite.. i just feel that certain things need to change in order for things to run more smoothly for both the consumer and the employees..edit- it has been six/6 days ( close enough to 1 week ) since i posted this review. i have yet to receive any type of guidance as to what the hold up with my application is!!?!? mind you this is my second draw using bizcredit.. i was reluctant to choose them again due to the ridiculousness a starving business owner must go through in order to receive the funds which where put into place for us.. but i thought to myself.. it has to be a much smoother process the second time around being that they already have all of my information.. i mean what else could they possibly need..!? nothing absolutely nothing..it‚Äôs the exact same info. by which i was funded the first ( previous ) time via their website/funding agents. it has now been 1 month/30 days since i submitted my ppp2 application. i have been stuck on ‚Äú needs more info ‚Äú for a couple of weeks now with absolutely zero help as to what ( exactly ) the information needed is. besides the generic pre written template stating ‚Äúplease connect your bank account to yodlee‚Äù ( i have received this email at least 10 times ) for which i completed the very first email that i received asking me to do so. the only way to verify that this was completed correctly is to see that my ach details are correct and loaded properly within my application on the website ..& of course they are, being that it‚Äôs the exact same account for which i received the first.. i mean they have been absolutely no help.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"all i can say is that this has been the absolute worst experience i‚Äôve ever had working with a company. no one seems to care, no one calls back after multiple contact attempts over considerable periods of time. there is no phone number where i could actually reach a human of course, i could only email. when i did get an email response, it had little to do with my question or issue, it was just some lip service or irrelevant data. then when i replied i‚Äôd wait days or more to hear anything back. i was very clear with my messages, that something very simple had to be reviewed or fixed, but i was met either with absolute silence or someone that didn‚Äôt understand the issue and i had to staall over again. when someone called, it was paychex and not biz2credit, and the paychex rep could not help. he could only supposedly pass on the information to biz2credit where of course it fell into that same chasm. in the end in order to get what i needed i had to accept their errors and less money than i was entitled to. so naturally in my opinion no one should ever use this company under any circumstances or they may have the same awful experience i did. they are in my  opinion an uncaring or inadequately understaffed organization.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,"if most will notice that all of a sudden this company received a slew of positive reviews out of no where. don‚Äôt believe them. either they paid people to make these false reviews, or they made all of them on their own. it‚Äôs pretty sad. i applied back on february 27th, submitted all of the necessary and requested documentation. i was approved and received an e-tran number on march 2nd. then everything went down hill. i received numerous requests for front and back copies of my photo id. i submitted my id 5 times at least. then to put icing on the cake, they sent me a link requesting direct access to my bank account to review deposits, etc. that was an immediate red flat to me. i personally know several other business owners that have received both the 1st and 2nd draw for the ppp, and none of them ever had to give actual access to their bank account. and finally what sealed the deal for me was when the company who i applied for the ppp loan through made the decision to no longer work with biz2credit due to their extensive delays in funding approved loans, along with them continuously requesting the same information and documentation that they had already received numerous times. along with a list of other reasons that was emailed to me and other consumers i would assume. save your time, and protect your information. these people are definitely scammers. go elsewhere.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,5,"biz2credit is amazing. last year during the worst of covid19 i was given the most utterly ridiculous runaround by kabbage. i had never been so badly mistreated by a company. but luckily such abuse led me to biz2credit. they tried their best to secure my ppp loan last minute on the final day before the program deadline hit thx to kabbage bailing at the last second after inspiring false hope for months. unfortunately there wasnt enough time, but i was so impressed with how they went above and beyond to help me when they didnt have to that i kept them at the forefront of my choices when the ppp reopened for round 2. fast forward to round 2 and dealing with biz2credit was a breeze. the process was straightforward and speedy with no bs unlike some other companies out there. as long as your documents are in order they kove you right along through the process and have plenty of quality in depth information available on their site. the only thing i wasnt a fan of was they had grown quite a bit in this time so i feel due to the client load i didnt get the kind of personalized experience and attention i did previously but i understand they were dealing with hundreds of thousands of applicants. now in taking my 2nd draw they have streamlined the process even.more and worked out the kinks and reapplying was incredibly easy and straightforward. biz2credit is a solid company and they have a lifelong customer in me when it comes to anything related to my companies financials. these guys rule!!!",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,to all legitimate businesses!.. do not do business with this company. i continue to get the run around with my application that i submitted in january and i  received an approval from sba. if the sba gave me a loan with the same paper work that i submitted to them there is nothing wrong with my docs its definitely this company. i submitted all docs multiple times. and they are still asking for the same info that i  originally uploaded. they have people from other countries processing applications and have no clue what they are doing. no one knows what a schedule k1 is and its so frustrating. you will not get anyone to straightening out anything. and they are doing there own reviews as well. i am reporting them to the sba. and i am not going to stop until i get the news involved about this company. the withdrawal button was an option on the site a few weeks ago. it has been removed so you can't withdraw your application yourself. so your being held hostage. so now im taking it to the news because there are too many people  dealing with the same issue with them. withdraw my application immediately,negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,i finally have an update on my ppp2 loan application that was sitting in limbo for over 2 months.... they saw these negative reviews and a specialist reached out to me to remedy the situation. i thought now that i had contact with a real person things would go better. i was wrong. it has now been over 3 weeks since they reached out and have started to help me. and still no funds. everyday i get a different excuse.....  sba approved my app for 44k. then biz2credit sent in a new application changing the loan amount from 44k to 16k without my consent or signature. they just filled it out and sent it...(illegal). this created an additional week hold up.later they were able to resend the original app and get it approved...... it has been 16 days since sba approved my loan... 80 days since i applied originally.....and has been 4 days since i signed my closing docs. still no updates....do not use biz2credit..... worst lender i have ever worked with.....,negative,positive
Biz2Credit,US,5,i would like to say i was originally unsure about this company as i was not sure the status of my application. i entrusted a cpa to do my ppp application. after receiving a response from biz2credit. i received an explanation to why my application was being held up. i want to say this company is doing the best they can to process millions of applications with overworked staff and there is a lot of fraud they have to weed out that is making it more difficult to quickly approve applications. please be patient and if you are asked for any documents submit them. if someone offers to help with your application make sure they are a credentialed person and you do your research. i trusted someone to do my application and it has caused great confusion. i am very pleased with this company and how they have been very understanding and patient in the ppp loan process.,positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,3,update march 29.  funded. while i wish i did not have to be a squeaky wheel there was no choice. to their credit they pay attention to those wheels and two days later they got it done    credit where credit is due i am sorry there is not a less than zero. this is an update to this week.  i signed my loan documents on march 12. i have now been told five times my status is waiting for contract signature.  i then send again which i have now seven times . i then get a note waiting for contract signature and as soon as i sign i‚Äôll get funded in like three weeks.  i truly believe at this point they are sitting in a room making conscious decisions to be simply cruel to people.  what other rational explanation can there be for such malfeasance and negligence?    i was asked by media clients to staa story but they would probably just enjoy that so when the apparent class action is started i guess i‚Äôll join that .    it is amazing in hard times such as this a company that takes the responsibility to help people makes a decision to ruin them.   and we can‚Äôt go anywhere else becuase they have locked my file.   i truly hope the regulators act even if it is too late for many of us.,neutral,negative

(as of this morning, that was removed and a ""few days"" for verification is now what it states)i'm currently well passed the funding deadline. all i'm asking is for my closing documents for funding.you do feel taken advantage by biz2credit because i've had other companies actually call and email asking to assist with ppp round 2. i would have preferred a better customer service experience. you stato feel trapped by their company - slightly held hostage.i do admit - their marketing was good. i think they simply overpromised and under delivered.of course i want to give this company 5 star because i understand how important reputation is as a business owner. being in limbo when you have employees is terrifying and the silence is deafening.i'm happy to update my review once i'm funded. plus, we are 6 days away from the 31st deadline so i'm sure everyone is on edge at this point.please assist.",neutral,positive
Biz2Credit,US,3,"my ppp loan application was approved and funded. however, the whole process was frustrating. it seems that customer service agents are overwhelmed and not competent. i followed up on my app by email and phone and received no response. instead, i was contacted by agents multiple times requesting the same info that was submitted weeks ago.  the loan was funded after 1.5 mo of application submission. although, i am relieved that the funds were deposited i would not use biz2credit again due to lack of communication.",neutral,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,this process is so long! i was informed less than a week. my bank rejected funding when it finally hit after 8 weeks because it was going into my savings vs checking. required an adjustment with my bank documents...its been another 5 weeks and i've recieved nothing. demolished my own savings and struggling to stay afloat. business owners that applied after me through other lenders were paid within a week. i can't even try my luck elsewhere. i'm just so upset. all i can do is wait.,negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,5,trust the process.   biz2credit made the application process quick and easy.  they provided plenty of feedback and i knew exactly where i was and what was needed for each step of my ppp application process.  i would highly recommend small business owners take a look and apply with biz2credit.,positive,positive
Biz2Credit,US,4,"i have to be 100% honest here, for everyone who is giving this company a bad rap. let me explain something to you. first off i received my first draw with biz to credit in january. my experience was flawless. funded in 5 days. now, my friend filled out an app the same day about 6 hours later and was not funded for 3 weeks. so you have to understand in that 6 hour timeframe 1000s of applications came in between. now since the biden administration made new rules tens of 1000s more people became eligible for ppp loans, thus flooding their system that was not designed to process millions of applications. they saw this and stopped accepting applications so they can catch up. they i'm sure are being flooded with fraudulent apps and if they do not have all the proper documentation they can be held responsible for the funds. now any true business person here would know that when your dealing with money in all aspects you have to use due diligence in protecting your assets. also  we are in the middle of a global pandemic so they i'm sure are shostaffed and finding employees is probably a nightmare. if your ppp loan is legit, have patience your money will come. those complaining about connecting your bank account is a clear indicator that something is amiss. if your stuff is legit it should not be a issue for you to do so. that means that when you uploaded your bank statements they feel something is off and want to verify that you are being true ""due dilligance"". if your statements were accurate and paper work was intact they would not ask for more. leaving these crazy reviews are not gonna get you anywhere. just relax and they will get to your app. i have already applied for my second draw ppp sole prop, i was approved by the sba, but i am patiently waiting my turn in the q. the only reason i left only 4 stars is i believe the communication could be a little better. the reason we use company's like biztocredit is because as a sole prop big banks tend to shoot for the higher loan amounts and put us little guys in the background. this company prioritizes the little guys.. again have patience all. you will get your money.",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,5,"i have had an incredible initial experience with biz2credit with the baseline approval, then receiving an etran number from the sba, and everything seemed like it was well on its way and i'd be able to continue business full speed ahead.. but then i was told i would be only eligible for an entirely different (and smaller loan) due to my schedule c.. when initially applying it gave the option of breaking down an individual months pay scale and that was to be the way that they would confirm the loan amount because i didn't have a full year in business so this only seemed like it made sense.. until i was told it was under review and they must have withdrawn that loan amount and the pandemic being what it is, in the recent months business has been basically at a stand still. not to mention it seems they have a problem with my banking institution. being through cash app. understandably my most recent banking statement has not as much activity as of course i would have liked but being a sole prop i use several different payment methods for my customers benefit, whether it is cash app or paypal or just outright cash.. for biz2credit to approve this initially and their lender, which from my understanding is basically them under the name itria ventures, is rather unfair and downright harmful considering i have went well past the window for the smallest businesses to receive focus, and now the deadline is drawing near, i fear i'm going to have to go at it alone and risk my independence simply because i hadn't utilized bank accounts to their liking. i hope no one else has had to deal with this type of situation because it brought me hope that i may be able to keep my in home work and force me to try and return to working for someone else once more.update**within a few hours of posting this review i was contacting by a very helpful person by the name of vaibhav sharma with the funding department of of this company and my issues were immediately resolved and i am on my way to being funded, i would highly recommend this to anybody who is looking to receive a small business loan",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"update after leaving this review biz2credit has cancelled my loan in caweb and also blocked me from online access so that i can‚Äôt apply for forgiveness from the first round that i obtained with them this is absolutely unacceptable i will be taking further legal action against them. please fund my loan and it shouldn‚Äôtnor should ever take 10-12 days once closing documents are signed. this is exactly why you have a host of negative reviews, quit holding onto people‚Äôs money that‚Äôs needed in a pandemic while i understand you need to do due diligence and are inundated, i can‚Äôt nor do i have the luxury of waiting longer for a loan that‚Äôs already approved and the documents are all signed.please help.hello this is insanity how can you guys run a business like this and fumble the ball for so many business that trusted you? this is absolutely unacceptable. i am taking further legal action against biz2credit and intria ventures i will file a class action law suit in ny, if i don‚Äôt get communication from your business that is clear and puts expectations on what i am to expect. i don‚Äôt appreciate the run around, neither do all the other small businesses you guys have just left in the dark. i am sitting on approved contract signed. i was told by many different people many different things. please close out my loan so i can go on with my life. sitting up at night throwing up and stressed out over this is just not right. you guys are frustrating lots of people, if i have a nervous breakdown or heaattack because of stress you guys are going to be in a whole lot more legal trouble. you guys have failed at the most important paof human decency and that is communication, you dont communicate and when you do it doesn‚Äôt make any sense. please fund my loan. it‚Äôs in the closing process waiting on you guys to fund it. i‚Äôm sick of the games and the run around i have been polite and calm i have been cool and collective i have been respectful and patient none of this seems to work with you guys. now i‚Äôm getting pissed off and that‚Äôs not something i like to be. i‚Äôm asking for my funds to be released to me no more 24-48 hour crap no more waiting everything is done all verification is done! what the hell are you guys waiting for? if you guys cause me to miss the deadline because you go backwards with everything meaning obtaining a etran number without doing verifications first this isn‚Äôt going to sit lightly,  i‚Äôll complain to anyone that will listen i will get an attorney to litigate this case if my business suffers any more harm or irreparable damage. this is just insanity. insanity that i have to spend my wednesday night at 11:01 sending this message also insanity that i have to feel like i need to stay on top of this 24-7 or else you guys won‚Äôt do your job or aren‚Äôt equipped to do your jobs. disburse my funds.update: i‚Äôm more confused than ever i have received an email fromsomeone in the funding dept after basically begging them to fund me because we are in dire straights, he said he will process closing asap that was 2-3 days ago. then i got one fromtommy binder saying the portalwas closed they will notify me when it‚Äôs open. i already applied and was approved waiting to be funded.  then he emailed me again out of the blue telling me my case has been escalated and to allow 24-48 hours for resolution. i don‚Äôt know what any of this means. i just need these funds to be able to get by and stay a float during these trying times. the first loan with them took a month. this one is going on 10 days since i initially applied the 15th. it‚Äôs like this company just doesn‚Äôt care about other businesses as they are making money hand over fist by processing the loans. all i‚Äôm asking for is transparency and a clear answer as to what‚Äôs happening. the lack of communication and generic responses are astounding. while everyone‚Äôs stressed out and times are trying for everyone, i feel like the process at biz2credit is super stressful and has my anxiety on a roller coaster, please communicate with me and close out my loan and i will update the bbb and trust pilot reviews accordingly. thank you.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"i am an authorized representative for several people. out of all the companies i've submitted applications through, biz2credit is the worst. i will contact the sba oig to complain about them. they should not be an approved ppp lender based on their process. they get etrans numbers without properly vetting the application. it causes delays and prevent the applicant from going to another lender with a better more timely process. they also ask for connection to bank accounts even after the documents have been submitted properly and approved by the sba. it's unnecessary. they need a quick withdrawal process so people can go elsewhere.",negative,negative
Biz2Credit,US,1,"this statement is objective to our experience with biz2credit. initially we applied for our ppp loan on 02.02.21. from the stathere was a major disconnect in communication. for an entire month we emailed, called and messaged on twitter every point of contact we had access to with b2c before we finally received a response. that response was via a customer service rep who fortunately for us, got our application moving and actually sent to the sba. that response was 03.04.21. 03.06.21 we received sba approval & our dashboard displayed ‚Äúaccepted by sba pending re-verification‚Äù along with our e-tran and loan number. the dashboard displayed the same until 03.16.21 where it then said ‚Äúmore information‚Äù was required. since then, they have repetitively (5-6x) asked for the same documents that we have uploaded to their site already. literally, the documents have been on their dashboard for days & they still keep requesting them - pushing our closing process further and further away. in addition to the long list of documents asked for, they also started asking for things not initially required by b2c. yesterday, 03.19.21 i went back and forth emailing with our loan specialist with them asking again for the same documentation that had already been provided / uploaded to the dashboard - weeks ago. in the evening we were back on the ‚Äúaccepted by sba - pending re-verification‚Äù screen. knowing, we had sent them everything asked for and then some, we presumed this would be over. we were wrong - today i woke up to ‚Äúmore information needed‚Äù again. 03.20.21. we are beyond our 10 business days since e-tran and almost two whole months since we initially applied. if the sba releases out e-tran because we have not yet been funded we have to stathis process all over again from the beginning. in addition, they are asking for documents that are not required by the cares act and further; they are asking us to connect our bank account to a 3rd party entity that has once already been in trouble for selling private banking information.i do not understand what they are doing. i will say though that our funding manager mr. savo has most certainly been communicative when we reach out to him. there i have no complaint. biz2credits negligence has cost us a supreme amount of time and energy. we do want to fund with them, but as i read more and more reviews i am beginning to think that that is not possible. as they keep moving the goal posts back i have to wonder if they may possibly be scamming businesses like mine. holding our e-tran hostage so we are unable to apply anywhere else while instead of doing any due diligence and reading the documentation that they asked for the first time - they keep asking over and over again for the same submissions. unacceptable. why are you dragging your feet to fund so many of us?today i am *considering* filing a fraud complaint with the sba oig (office of inspector general) office. i am preparing statements for my congressional representatives and have filed a bbb complaint in tandem. if we do not see movement on our ppp then we will be opening claims. the ppp was designed to help save businesses, and biz2credits backward ways of managing their applications have done many of us a major disservice. i am a disabled veteran spending the majority of my disability benefits on keeping this business afloat. two entire months of stalling and playing games is unacceptable. i have been polite and patient in all of our communication & still this is happening. if b2c funds our company i will write a new review and rescind the bbb complaint. i will of course not file complaint with oig either. but as they have done to others, if they withdraw my application without my consent or deny us erroneously i will update this to reflect that so you are all aware of how they operate. the sba approved our application, we should have been funded already but b2c‚Äôs backwards application process and negligence has prevented that. i tried to be as objective as possible when writing this. thank you for reading.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,horrible experience do not recommend to anyone!!!!!!! i applied on feb. 24 was accepted by sba. dashboard kept displaying more information needed because supposedly i didn't sign the sba form which i did. i found the completed sign document uploaded it in a email then my dashboard changed. then it went from approved now my application is withdrawn!!! i have emailed several times they have gotten back to me twice with a generated email on both emails!!! i am so furious and frustrated! everyone who applied the same day as me and even after me is already funded and i am basically sos! my business is failing and i desperately needed the funds. i have emailed again and of course no one has gotten back to me!!! time will run out and i will not be able to try with another bank because i was already approved and had a sba e tran number. do not ever use them !!!!,negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,"i'll staby saying the experience i've had with this ""fine"" company has fallen shoof even the 1 star i was required to give it. now before i give my opinion on this company i'll stawith absolute facts. we submitted an application for ppp loan on january 29 and it was submitted to sba the same day, fact. it has now been a month and nearly a half with not a word from company on this, fact. i have tried calling multiple numbers multiple times to no avail, fact. i went to website where it says contact us and filled out the info with my question only to have the site tell me i wasn't authorized on the server to send the message, fact. i've had emails bounced back more than a couple times stating the address i sent to wasn't valid, fact. i've grown weary and a tad bit suspicious of this process and company, fact. now that's out of the way so ill move on to the opinion portion of the review. it is my opinion and only my opinion,take it for what u will but it's only an opinion. i feel like this company is completely inept at the task they are being asked to perform. i feel that maybe if they are a little overwhelmed with the volume off applications, but that's their problem not the applicants. i feel the way this company is running right now is completely ridiculous and they should reevaluate their corporate structure from the top down. i feel like maybe their employees and company in general could not care less about the plight of their applicants. i feel that if they submit to sba they should verify everything on app first rather than just sending it off, which locks up the application and prevents the applicant from applying elsewhere. it seems to me that the submission of the application may be just a way to hold the loan from the applicant and prevent another funding source from getting the loan done, just a maybe not stating as fact. now for my factual opinion. this company is horrible based on my experience and preponderance of the facts that i have. i would not recommend them to my worst enemy at this point, even they shouldn't be ignored like this. if you're looking for frustration and some wasted time you'll never get back then these are your guys. however if you actually want funding you would likely be better off just going around collecting cans to recycle, it would likely get you to your goal faster. in conclusion boo to biz2credit!",negative,negative
Biz2Credit,US,1,"biz2credit does not communicate with its ppp clients/customers. you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning, than ever speaking to them on the phone. after sitting in ‚Äúinformation needed‚Äù status for 2 weeks i finally got fed up and emailed at least 30 contacts there. they completely miscalculated my ppp loan and in lieu of that i began to email every single contact email address i could find online and on reddit. i want to return my funds, as the sba already informed me i can return the funds and reapply. biz2credit used the figure in line 31 of my schedule c, divided it by 12 and then multiplied it by 2.5. i started my business november 24, 2019. so exactly why in the world did they divide line 31 by 12 if i wasn‚Äôt in business for 12 months in 2019 but only for 1 month. i detest the idiot that drafted my contract. this is a human error and absolutely unacceptable. i just want to return the funds and reapply so i may receive the ppp dollar amount that is rightfully mine. very disappointed in you biz2credit. case id biz592983‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,"nightmare! we submitted our application in january. we have tried hundreds of times to call, automate service, so you cannot speak to anyone. if you leave an email, they sent you an automated email, that tells you nothing, it never answers any of your questions. once they submit to the sba for a loan , you cannot get a loan from anyone else. and this company will not tell you if you are approved or not.their website is up ad down, and locks you out, for no reason, and you cant get a status. its a huge waste of time, and now, we cant get a loan from any other lender because they only assign to 1 lender. i read online, that a group has started a class action law suit. we would love to sign up for that. we hold them responsible, for the fact that we will be out of business, a business that has been around since 1998. they have destroyed us and many other companies. if only we had known! so we are warning you now, dont apply here. if you are one of the thousand this company has done this to, please warn others. we also contacted our congress person, the bbb, and are in the process of trying to get the news media involved, they seem interested and said they have many others that have contacted them about biz2credit.",negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,i have been dealing with the biz2credit loan process for over a month now and it‚Äôs really becoming a frustration. i received my sba approval and etran number on feb 5 signed all documents and uploaded everything needed and i still have not heard or been updated. i have reached out to biz2credit by email and phone and i still have not been able to contact anyone. i thought i was doing a good thing by going through this lender but it has been a complete hassle for me and i am still without funds. i really want to keep my business going but from the looks it‚Äôs hard to say. i also contacted them stating i would like to cancel my loan because i was approved by another lender but i have to have them cancel the first lenders app before proceeding so now i am at a stand still. i hope to get some answers by this week because i don‚Äôt know what else to do at this point.,negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,5,"mine is a small business, in operation since 2017. i got my first ppp loan from wells fargo bank. it was easy - not much troubles experienced. as the funds were totally exhausted from the first ppp loan and my business impacted due to pandemic, i needed the 2nd ppp loan. applied via wells fargo on 19th jan 2021. as i heard a lot of things that don't rely on one bank only for loan and due to fraud sba has more checks - i applied via chase also. both the banks i have business checking accounts.  both the banks rejected my loan application with very generic and high level error message like ""unable to verify average monthly payroll cost from information you provided"" from chase and similar kind of message from wells fargo. chase was quick to reject me while wells fargo was slow. i tried contacting both the banks but realized that my loan amount might be too low for them or they are real big organizations(typical scenarios where each unit work in silos and nobody tells others or in other words - left hand doesn't know what right hand is doing?) nobody knew what is the exact issue with my application and what exactly is missing. i reapplied it from wells fargo and chase. this vicious cycle went for quite some time. i got rejected by chase 10 times and wells fargo by 3 times in 5-6 weeks. there was no clue and no solution except searching on the internet. from reddit i come to know about lenders like biz2credit and crossriversba.com. i thought let's try them based on reddit comments. first applied by crossriversba - they were taking their own time. so thought try with biz2credit. one thing  - i can tell you that both biz2credit.com and crossriversba.com application forms were very simple and very much too the point(they asked the right questions in order to get the right answers). i can't believe that on the 2nd days i got the call from biz2credit.com - he told me what all documents i need to provide in the next stage. after 5 days - i come to know that my application is approved and submitted to sba. on the 10th day-i had the 2nd docusign and sba loan was approved. on the 12th day - i can see that sba loan ach was initiated to my wells fargo business checking account. i can't believe how awesome biz2credit.com is. i hired back my employees and back to business. yes, of course - i got the emails from both wells fargo and chase that after 10 days that sba application from other lender is approved so they will cancel my application.if you are small business and having a loan of $50k or less - better to work with biz2credit.com or smaller lender. no need to waste time with big banks. i am from it background. when you do coding and there is an error - ide/compiler tells you exactly what is the error and which line. ppp loan process should be as transparent as that. there should be human touch - required number of people working in the company who is servicing you. not too many people like in wells fargo and chase - so many people and almost 75% of them are good for nothing.",positive,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"final update: this update is for other small businesses that this company is scamming. if you have been lied to about your loan closing in 6-7 business days, have received sba approval but this company is too incompetent to actually close on your loan, cancel your application with this company and stawith a better lender. try paypal/amex who are working with credible affiliates. and go to the sba's page or google ""file sba complaint"" and file your complaint against this horrible company for wasting taxpayer funds and lying to customers. update: is it possible to give 0 stars? since i posted the review below, i have finally heard from my loan processor, who told me that the business co-owner never signed her form 2483. so i queried her, and it turns out she signed the form in january, and it was confirmed by biz2credit! nevertheless, i sent the form back to the processor again, only for him to disappear again. today, i received another email from biz2credit saying ""we sent you a form to sign."" well, guess what, i looked over all my emails, including junk folders, and there is no email from biz2credit to sign (or from docusign for that matter). at this point, i think biz2credit is just toying with me. they are holding up my application, and making it impossible for me to apply through another lender, because they supposedly have received sba approval for my business. truly, avoid this company like the plague!i would take the glowing reviews with a big grain of salt. this company has been nothing but trouble. don't trust them! once you're stuck with them, you will not be able to apply with another lender!so, i applied for a ppp loan through biz2credit back in january. finally, on feb 9, i received an email that we were approved, and have received an sba loan number, and that it would take 6-7 business days for the loan to close. meantime, please upload your bank information. well, today is march 4, and amazingly, no money, no closing package! i emailed the loan processor who is listed on my account, and received a long auto-response basically saying wait, don't call me, we'll call you. what a horrendous experience. this is just the continued screwing over of small businesses. don't waste your time. they don't care whether you get a loan or not.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,no one cares! agents barely reply to your emails. you have to email them multiple times before you get a answer. i was approved for higher loan amount upon checking the closing documents my loan amount decreased. it‚Äôs really not fair how biz2credit treat established businesses but people who does fraud have high loan amounts and get approved fairly quickly. i would stay away from this company. i really tried to give them a chance. but it‚Äôs like screaming at a brick wall. some agents have changed their emails so some emails get routed back to you. it‚Äôs ridiculous. i‚Äôm surprised the sba supports this company. very unprofessional and some agents are very passive aggressive both emails and calls. seems like a puppet show. i just want to be funded the loan amount i was approved for which was significantly higher.,negative,positive

Biz2Credit,US,1,"if i could give 0 stars i would. i was approved by sba on 2/16. i signed my sba forms via docusign, was pending verification, approved, then switched to not accepted by sba on 2/24/21. i thought it may be a glitch so i gave it a day. i sent emails to my loan specialist tommy, other loan specialist, sam and daphak. i also emailed suppoand the biz 2 management team. all i recieved was automated messages. my loan is still showing active in cafs/caweb. the sba rep says there are no error codes and my application was approved. despite all my attempts to have this resolved my dashboard remain on not accepted by sba. it's unfair that my business may miss out on due to biz 2's negligence. my case id number is biz630391. i uploaded all needed docs in the correct format and still no response. do not trust this company!!after writing this review i received a response from sparsh kapoor stating what the dash board says that my application was denied by sba and closed my ticket. i never received an explanation as to why i am still showing active in caweb. and why the sba states there were no error codes on my application and that my application was approved as it states on their website. biz 2's rep never looked into my case only gave a quick response because of my review.  again do not trust them!! they will secure your funds and tell you youve been denied.",negative,negative

Biz2Credit,US,1,i applied for ppp on 02/06/2021. received etran number on 02/08/2021 signed 2483 on 02/10/2021. went from approved status to needing more information and has been stuck there for almost 3 weeks.  have sent funding specialist several emails but they keep getting kicked back due to his email being full. have emailed several individuals with biz2credit with no response.  emailed suppoand received a response 10 days after email was sent and still no process with loan.  this experience has been extremely stressful and no one with the company has taken the time to update me if any further information is  needed and if needed what is needed.  in the next few days i will be starting chemotherapy and this has my blood pressure off the charts.,negative,positive
